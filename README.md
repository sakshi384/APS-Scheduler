# APS-Scheduler
The ability to schedule background jobs is a requirement for most modern web apps. These jobs might be user-oriented, like sending emails; administrative, like taking backups or synchronizing data; or even a more integral part of the app itself.  On a single server deployment a system level tool like cron is the obvious choice to accomplish this kind of scheduling. However, when deploying to a cloud platform like Heroku, something higher level is required since instances of the application will be running in a distributed environment where machine-local tools are not useful.  The Heroku Scheduler add-on is a fantastic solution for simple tasks that need to run at 10 minute, hourly, or daily intervals (or multiples of those intervals). But what about tasks that need to run every 5 minutes or 37 minutes or those that need to run at a very specific time? For these more unique and complicated use cases running your own scheduling process can be very useful.
